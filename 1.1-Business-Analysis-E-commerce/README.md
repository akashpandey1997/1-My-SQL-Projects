# E-Commerce-platform-Sales-Analysis-in-SQL
This project involves an advanced analysis of sales of an E-Commerce platform by My SQL workbench.

## Objective
The project aims to understand the behavior of users and sellers on the platform, identify key performance indicators, and uncover potential areas for improvement. The analysis includes understanding sales trends, identifying top-selling products, analyzing payment methods, calculating return rates, and identifying inactive users. It also involves categorizing users based on their contribution to sales and identifying sellers who frequently delay orders. The insights gained from this project can help in making informed decisions to enhance user experience and improve operational efficiency.

## Insights
The SQL project provides several key insights into the operations and performance of the e-commerce platform:
1. Sales Trends: The SKU-level sales analysis helps in understanding the sales pattern and identifying the most and least popular products. This can guide inventory management and marketing efforts.
2. Payment Preferences: The analysis of COD orders gives an insight into the preferred payment methods of customers in different states. This can help in tailoring payment options to customer preferences.
3. Return Rates: The percentage of returns booked out of total orders placed provides a measure of customer dissatisfaction and can indicate potential issues with product quality or order fulfillment.
4. Customer Retention: Identifying churned buyers helps in understanding customer retention and can guide efforts to re-engage inactive customers.
5. Refunds: Analyzing users who have received significant refunds can help identify potential issues with certain orders or products.
6. Seller Performance: Identifying sellers who frequently delay orders can help in maintaining service quality standards on the platform.
7. User Segmentation: Bucketing users into Large, Medium, and Small based on their sales contribution helps in understanding the revenue distribution among users and can guide personalized marketing efforts.
8. Cohort Analysis: This gives an understanding of how users who joined in the same month behave over time, providing insights into user retention and lifecycle.
